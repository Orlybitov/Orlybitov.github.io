          I am a caring and open-minded psychodynamic therapist who
          provides trauma informed client-centred therapy to individuals in
          downtown Toronto.
        </p>

        <p>
          Psychodynamic Psychotherapy is a collaborative talk therapy that
          offers ways to identify, and possibly change, problematic behaviours,
          feelings, and thoughts by exploring unconscious meanings and
          motivations.
        </p>
        <p>
          My clients include individuals of any gender identity, sexual
          orientation, religion, culture, and ability. I have experience working
          with (but not limited to) anxiety, depression, addictions, grief,
          stress, career changes, life transitions, trauma, sexual abuse, family
          conflict, relationship challenges, feelings of worthlessness, and
          existential issues.
        </p>
        <p>
          The most important decision to make in pursuing therapy is choosing a
          therapist that is right for you.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>
            I invite you to come and meet me for a free consultation
          </b>
          where youâ€™ll be able to tell me what brings you to therapy, ask any
          questions you might have, get a sense of how a session feels, and
          assess whether I am a good fit for you.

      <section id="about" class="about">
        <h2 class="content-subhead">About Me</h2>
        <p>
          I am a Registered Psychotherapist, licensed with the
          College of Registered Psychotherapists of Ontario (CRPO), as well as a
          member of the Canadian Association of Psychodynamic Therapy (CAPT). I
          am a graduate of the Ontario Psychotherapy and Counseling Program (5
          years), and I hold a Social Service Worker diploma from George Brown
          College.
          <br />
          Along with my private practice, I worked for many years as
          a community mental health worker, providing support to vulnerable and
          marginalized populations who struggle with complex mental health and
          addiction issues.
        </p>
        <p>
          I work from strength-based, trauma informed, client-centred, and
          anti-oppressive frameworks, where I build and maintain strong and
          collaborative therapeutic relationships with my clients. In addition
          to finding relief from symptoms such as anxiety and depression, I help
          clients explore the source of those symptoms, tailoring our work for
          individual needs. I use a variety of techniques and interventions
          including psychodynamic supportive and uncovering, compassion-
          focused therapy, and trauma-informed therapy, as well as
          mindfulness and dream work. Our work together could help you gain
          insight, find meaning and explore more effective ways of being and
          relating to others. This process can bring deeper self-knowledge and
          understanding leading to change, growth, and a better sense of
          wellbeing.
        </p>
        <p>
          I believe that to be an effective therapist, it is essential to have
          first-hand experience of what it is like to work through challenges
          from a client's perspective. It is for this reason that my training as
          well as personal circumstance has led me to my own extensive therapy,
          which has enriched my practice and ability to fully engage
          authentically with my clients.
